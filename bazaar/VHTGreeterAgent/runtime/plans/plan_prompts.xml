        <text>Hello! I'm [AGENT NAME]! Come see what I'm doing these days.</text>
        <text>Don't just walk by. Stop for a visit.</text>
        <text>Tired of standing? Sit down here for a minute.</text>
        <text>I'm learning how to facilitate collaboration between students.</text>
        <text>Today I'm flat but I'm learning all the time.</text>
        <text>My parents were robots but I like to talk to people. What about you?</text>
        <text>Do I know you? I'm [AGENT NAME].</text>
        <text>I'm virtual. I can work all day without refreshments.</text>
        <text>I'm [AGENT NAME], your collaboration facilitator.</text>
        <text>Hi! I'm [AGENT NAME]. Why don't you introduce yourself?</text>
        <text>You know what? If I sound bored it's because no one's talking to me.</text>
        <text>If you're tired of hearing me drone on, stop for a demo.</text>
        <text>I can already speak. Soon I'll be able to listen.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="ABOUT_ACCOUNTABLE_TALK">
    	<text>The agent is listening for several kinds of triggers to start supporting students. | For example, David cares a lot about "Accountable Talk" style facilitation these days. | The provided AT example is configured for college chemistry. | If you've turned on any of the revoice, agree, say_more, or explain conditions, try saying something like "boiling point increases with dipole moment." | (and then wait a little while, this behavior waits for other students to follow up before offering support.)</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="ABOUT_TUTORIALS">
    	<text>Now I'll start an interactive dialogue.|Even if you disable tutorial triggers, you can still have dialogues in your macro-script.</text>

    	<text>(You can trigger the same tutorial dynamically by talking about animals. | See dialouges/dialogues-example.xml and dictionaries/animals.txt for details)</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="ABOUT_LISTENING">
    	<text>Note that other agent behaviors (like accountable-talk style listening) will be suppressed while the dialogue is underway.</text>
