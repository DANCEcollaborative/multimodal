# Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout

The [Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-automatic-graph-layout/) engine is used to visualize diagnostics information in PsiStudio. The `GraphViewer` control here provides a WPF-specific rendering of the graph. It is a fork from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/automatic-graph-layout/tree/master/GraphLayout/tools/WpfGraphControl) and is used with their permission.
